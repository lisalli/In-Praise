        <p class="bodyText" style="margin-bottom: 10vh;">A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the
            paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove where it is darkest.
            Whenever I
            see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows,
            our
            sensitive use of shadow and light. For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. An
            empty
            space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows
            within
            emptiness. There is nothing more. And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam,
            around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are
            overcome
            with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that
            here
            in the darkness immutable tranquility holds sway. The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably
            refers to the uncanny silence of these dark places. And even we as children would feel an inexpressible
            chill as
            we peered into the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where lies the key to
            this
            mystery? illtimately it is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove
            would in that instant revert to mere void.
